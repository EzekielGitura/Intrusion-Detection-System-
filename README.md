## Intrusion Detection System (IDS) Overview

This repository contains the implementation of a two-part Intrusion Detection System (IDS) designed to monitor and safeguard network traffic and system activities.It acans for known attack signatures and responds to them in real-time.

### Detection Mechanism
It identifies potential threats by:
- Monitoring network traffic and system logs.
- Detecting suspicious patterns, anomalies, or known attack signatures.
- Comparing activities against predefined rules or machine learning models.

### Response and Logging
Responsible for:
- Recording detected events for analysis.
- Triggering alerts to notify administrators of potential threats.
- Coordinating with other systems to block or mitigate attacks.

### Purpose
Together, these components ensure real-time detection and response to potential security threats, enhancing the safety and integrity of networks and systems.
